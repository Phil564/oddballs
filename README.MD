# oddballs
glover early builds source

very incomplete

## how to build/setup

1. (for now) please place the repository close to the root of the drive in the "Pc" folder (example: E:\Pc\oddballs)
2. install Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 (iso can be easily found, same as cd key. i mounted it with poweriso, keys are easy to find for that as well)
3. get the DirectX 3.0 SDK. place the "SDK" folder in a dxsdk folder in the root of the repository (example: E:\Pc\oddballs\dxsdk\SDK)
4. run build.bat
5. (for modern systems, windows 7 specifically) place the [D3DRM dll from dgVoodoo2](https://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/bin/D3DRM.zip) next to the game executable (todo check if its exclusive to dgVoodoo or if it's its own thing)
6. connect an XInput controller. xbox one controllers confirmed to work
7. open oddballs.exe in one of the build directories
8. enjoy the unfinished video game
